# Devsoc Submcommittee Recruitment Task

## Frontend Task
I have recreated the Freerooms website based on the given design image.
These are the frameworks and libraries I have used:
- React
- NextJs
- TailwindCSS
- Google Fonts Material Icons

To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Redirect to `/frontend/demo` directory
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
4. Run `npm run start` to start the server
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

In the demonstration, I have replicated the design image as closely as possible.
The layout is responsive based on the screen size which fits the design images.
The website are still not fully functional but with React and NextJs frameworks,
it is easy to add functionalities to the website in the future.
The website are built with reusable components in /src/components directory,
this makes it easier to maintain each element on the page.
The building info are stored in a JSON file called `buildingInfo.json` in /src directory.
By adding new building info to the JSON file,
the website will automatically generate the new building card on the page with the same design.
